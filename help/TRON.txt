{{PageDescription}}
*'''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|Not supported in QB64.]]'''
* When line number tracing is on, the line numbers of statements are output immediately before they are executed.
* Use {{KW|TROFF}} to turn off line number tracing.
* Line number tracing only has an effect when programs are compiled with debugging code (&lt;tt>BC.EXE /D&lt;/tt>).
